## Overview

### Why Astro?

* For a small site like this, there's no need for heavy frameworks.
* Moving from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3 was painful.

### Vue

Astro works with many frameworks. I picked Vue for most parts of the code, even if it wasn't always necessary. When I
needed special features like `<Image />`, I used Astro directly instead of Vue.

### Domain Design

If you look at the `src/domains` folder, every page is organized by domain. All utils, types, and other stuff for a page
live inside its own folder.

### PageDef

Inside the `domains` folder, functions that end with `PageDef` define each page. They return a fixed output to avoid
broken links. Yes, the code is a bit more verbose where used, but that's a good trade-off.

### Duplicate Code

There's some code duplication in the calculators, which are the site's main feature. The general calculators stay mostly
stable, but the very specific ones might change over time because of my experience as a Turkish citizen. Things often go
in unexpected ways here :) So I just copy-pasted instead of overcomplicating.

### Color Extraction for Thumbs

The Telefon Vergisi HesaplayÄ±cÄ± and Konsol Vergisi HesaplayÄ±cÄ± have presets with thumbs. Each thumb shows a colored card
with its dominant color. To do this automatically, I made an Astro integration called `extract-color-from-thumbs`. It
loads the thumbs, gets the main color using the `fast-average-color-node` library, and saves the result in a
`.generated` folder.

At first, I tried to do this in the browser, and it worked. But Astro builds run in Node, so the color extraction
libraries didn't work properly there. I found some libraries that worked in Node but not in the browser, so the final
solution is a bit hacky, but it works for now.

### Presets

The Telefon Vergisi HesaplayÄ±cÄ± and Konsol Vergisi HesaplayÄ±cÄ± have presets. Every day, a new phone is announced.
Currently, I'm only adding flagship phones from Apple and Samsung. Apple is the main focus because, according to
analytics, none of this site's users really care about Samsung. I'll only add Samsung phones if I need to or if they
voluntarily pay me to do it. ðŸ’€

Also, the presets include prices that are manually updated. So, don't expect precision. These calculations only provide
information about taxes.

### SVG Cache

I tested a new approach for managing SVGs by grouping them all inside one `<svg />` as `<symbol />` elements and
referencing them with `<use />`. This prevents repeating SVG code and helps reduce the HTML size. (But if an SVG is only
used once, this actually increases the HTML size.)

I built a simple Map cache in `svg-cache.ts` to store SVGs, make symbols, and add them to the end of `<body />`. It
works in theory, but with Vue components using `client:load` on many pages, the cache breaks. So I commented this part
out for now until I find a better way.

### Exchange Rates

I prefer free exchange rate services that do not require an API key. Free APIs are not precise, but since the calculator
on this site is not financially critical, precision is not that important. Exchange rates are fetched during the build
process.

### Tests

Tests in the `__test__` folder follow the directory structure. I wrote as many tests as I could, but for big and complex
files, I skipped them without worry.

### UI and CSS

I made my own UI library based on my design ideas. Sometimes I reinvented the wheel just for fun. When building
components:

* CSS properties must be well organized.
* Always use `rem` units.
* All CSS variables and SASS mixins start with the `vh` prefix.
* Components should be as accessible as possible.
* Components should behave and look like native HTML elements.
* I love trying new web features, but only if there's a good polyfill and they
  are [Baseline Widely-available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility).

### Articles

There are many AI-generated articles in the `src/content` folder. They look like SEO posts, but I put them there first
just to show ad publishers the site wasn't empty. Later, these articles started getting visitors from search engines, so
now they actually help with SEO a little. I don't like it.
